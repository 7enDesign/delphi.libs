Deltics delphi.libs
===================

As the name of this repository suggests, here-in you will find a collection 
of libraries that contain a diverse array of useful functionality.

Some of these are entirely stand-alone libraries, but most have some dependency
on others.  `rtl` in particular is often required by the other libraries
as this library contains a great deal of small, highly re-usable classes and
functions etc.

**Delphi.libs** contains the **Smoketest** testing framework.


Installation
------------

The only 'installation' required for using these libraries is that you add the 
includes folder `+inc` to your compiler search path either on a per project basis 
or in your IDE Library settings (recommended).


Documentation
-------------

In addition to any **README.MD** files which may be found in various locations in the
libs repository, additional documentation is available in the repository Wiki
and on my web site (see "Support" below).


External Dependencies
---------------------

Test projects currently assume the use of the FastMM4 memory manager (FastMM4 *must*
be on the IDE search path).
